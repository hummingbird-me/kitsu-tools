RailsAdmin.config do |config|
  ################  Global configuration  ################

  # Set the app name.
  config.main_app_name = ['Biribiri', 'Admin']

  # Who is the current user.
  config.current_user_method { current_user }

  config.actions do
    dashboard

  end

  # If you want to track changes on your models:
  # config.audit_with :history, 'User'

  # Or with a PaperTrail: (you need to install it first)
  # config.audit_with :paper_trail, 'User'

  # Display empty fields in show views:
  # config.compact_show_view = false

  # Number of default rows per-page:
  # config.default_items_per_page = 20

  # Exclude specific models (keep the others):
  # config.excluded_models = ['Anime', 'Casting', 'Character', 'Genre', 'Person', 'Producer', 'Quote', 'Recommendation', 'Review', 'User']

  # Include specific models (exclude the others):
  config.included_models = ['Anime', 'Casting', 'Character', 'Episode', 'Video', 'Franchise', 'GalleryImage', 'Genre', 'Person', 'Producer', 'Quote', 'Review', 'Story', 'Substory', 'User', 'Group', 'Manga', 'App', 'PartnerDeal']

  # Label methods for model instances:
  # config.label_methods << :description # Default is [:name, :title]


  ################  Model configuration  ################
  
  config.model 'User' do
    edit do
      field :email
      field :to_follow
      field :ninja_banned
    end
  end

  # Each model configuration can alternatively:
  #   - stay here in a `config.model 'ModelName' do ... end` block
  #   - go in the model definition file in a `rails_admin do ... end` block

  # This is your choice to make:
  #   - This initializer is loaded once at startup (modifications will show up when restarting the application) but all RailsAdmin configuration would stay in one place.
  #   - Models are reloaded at each request in development mode (when modified), which may smooth your RailsAdmin development workflow.


  # Now you probably need to tour the wiki a bit: https://github.com/sferik/rails_admin/wiki
  # Anyway, here is how RailsAdmin saw your application's models when you ran the initializer:

  #       # items_per_page 100    # Override default_items_per_page

  #     # also see the create, update, modal and nested sections, which override edit in specific cases (resp. when creating, updating, modifying from another model in a popup modal or modifying from another model nested form)

  #     # using `field` instead of `configure` will exclude all other fields and force the ordering
