### What is Hummingbird?

Hummingbird is a modern anime discovery platform that helps you track the anime you're watching, discover new anime and socialize with other fans.

### Contributing

The backend is a JSON API server built with Rails, Postgres, ElasticSearch, and Redis. The frontend is a client-side application written using Ember.

To get started, clone this repository, install Docker (via Docker for Mac/Windows or Docker-Machine if you're not on Linux) and run `bin/setup && bin/start` to get a development version running. Before you start working be sure to read the [contribution guide](https://github.com/hummingbird-me/hummingbird/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

To get data into your development server, download [our media database dump](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ui1xaialiq67bnu/anime.sql.gz?dl=0) and use `gzcat anime.sql.gz | bin/psql hummingbird_development`.
