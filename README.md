### What is Hummingbird?

Hummingbird is a modern anime discovery platform that helps you track the anime you're watching, discover new anime and socialize with other fans.

### Contributing

The backend uses Rails, Postgres and Redis. The front-end is mostly a client-side application written using Ember, though there are still legacy pages rendered by Rails and some performance-sensitive code (the library) using React.
