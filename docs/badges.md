# Achievement Badges

Hummingbird would like to be able to reward active users for using the site in a way that allows them to
show off their reputation in the community as well as the variety of anime and dramas they have watched,
manga they have read, etc.  Hummingbird's badges could be similar in style to 
[those of MALGraph](https://github.com/rr-/malgraph4/wiki/Achievements).

In this document, we describe the categories of badges available, as well as the specific badges in each
category, how they are unlocked, and what they represent.  This guide is meant to serve largely as a
developer-first specification of how badges will be implemented, but in such a way that user documentation
(in the form, for example, of a blog post) could be easily written.
