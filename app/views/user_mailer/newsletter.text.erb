Hi.

Hummingbird is open source.

We hit the front-page of Hacker News and we're trending on GitHub. That's like pulling your pants down in front of the entire school on the one day you decided it wasn't worth finding clean underwear. I guess what I'm trying to say is, our code is a little messy but we're sharing it with you anyway.

This is important for Hummingbird because it helps us grow faster and it keeps things more interesting for everyone involved. Another bonus is that if we die fighting a bear, shark or a flippin' bear shark, someone else can pick up where we left off.

Go ahead, have a look at this mindless, soulless killing machine:

We're currently the 7th most popular repo in the last 24 hours on GitHub. We REALLY want to hit top 5 so that we can be included in their secret email club and get the limited edition decoder ring.

Can you take 1 minute and 'star' our repo? It would mean the world, and I'll either kiss you on the mouth or buy you fine alcohol should we ever happen to cross paths... unless you're a minor, in which case I can't legally fulfill either promise. Hugs are still cool.

Here's the repo, star that shit:

Thanks jerk, love you lots!

Josh and Vikhyat
